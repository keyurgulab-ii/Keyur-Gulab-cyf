    <h1>Cows</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    Cows are some of the most peaceful and fascinating animals on the planet.
    I have always enjoyed learning about them because they play such an important 
    role in agriculture and culture around the world. Cows are known for their 
    calm nature, expressive eyes, and strong sense of community within their herds. 
    They can recognize faces, form friendships, and communicate through a variety
    of sounds and body movements. 
    Beyond their importance in farming, cows are simply enjoyable to watch.
    Their slow, relaxed movements give them a gentle presence that many people 
    find comforting and even therapeutic.
